# Toontown-Level-Editor


Thank you for checking out the Repo!
This is the Toontown Level Editor, with this you can make your own PLAYGROUNDS, STREETS and other neat things!
I have included the Phase Files so go ahead and play with it! All you need is a source that can load .DNA files and if it uses .pdna, it should be easy to convert to .pdna
If you need help with converting to a .pdna I will write a guide up on how to do it, it takes at least 20 seconds to convert.
Feel free to Fork and make your own changes, or Star if you like it.

Have fun!

# GUIDE - FOR THOSE WITH A .PDNA SOURCE


Well to use this, you are going to need 3 things. Python 2.7, a street or playground and the libpandadna compiler from loblao.
Python 2.7 = https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/python-2.7.11.msi
libpandadna = https://github.com/loblao/libpandadna or clone with, https://github.com/loblao/libpandadna.git

After you have downloaded or cloned it, go to the compiler folder.
Put your .dna file into the compiler folder.
Once in there, open command prompt and type compile.py streetname.dna (EX. compile.py tutorial_street.dna)
After you are finished, you are going to want to replace the .dna and .pdna over the old ones, make sure you back them up!

If you need any other help, feel free to ask!
